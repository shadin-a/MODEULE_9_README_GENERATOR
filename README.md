# READ ME GENERATOR

* For this assignment, we used inquirer to create an interactive terminal where anyone who needed to generate a readme.md could input their information and a file would be created with the appropriate formatting and data.
* The more complicated section of this was realizing that the lisence generator was not more complex than I thought it would be. This challenge simply reaffirmed that I should, in fact, make sure functions only have one (1) job. With that logic I understand why the stubbing was split into three functions whereas I would have originally put them all into the same function.
